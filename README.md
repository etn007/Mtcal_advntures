# Mtcal_Advntures
The current goal is to host whatever interesting and cool concepts I have learnt in mathematics usually from my own hobbies or perhaps some talks I may attend. I am only a first year student so I wouldn't really expect my work to be completely free of errors, so any help would be greatly accepted
